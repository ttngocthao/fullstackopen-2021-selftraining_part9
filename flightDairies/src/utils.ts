//function is a so called type guard.
//That means it is a function which returns a boolean 
//and which has a type predicate as the return type. 
//more info:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards
const isString =(text:unknown): text is string =>{
    //?Why there are two conditions in the string type guard?
    //Most likely the simpler form is good enough for all practical purposes.
    //However, if we want to be absolutely sure, both conditions are needed.

//!Parsing and validating the date object
//Since TypeScript doesn't really know a type for a date, we need to treat it as a string.
const isDate =(date:string):boolean =>{

const parseWeather =(weather:unknown):Weather =>{

//!the unknown type does not allow any operations, so also accessing the fields is not possible.
//Todo: fix this by destructuring the fields to variables of the type unknown 
/*
* type Fields = { comment : unknown, date: unknown, weather: unknown, visibility: unknown };
* const toNewDiaryEntry = ({ comment, date, weather, visibility } : Fields): NewDiaryEntry => {
*/
//Todo: The other option to bypass the problem would be to use the type any for the parameter and disable the lint rule for that line:


// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
export const toNewDiaryEntry =(object:any):NewDiaryEntry=>{
    //? parse each field 
    //? and make sure that the return value is exactly of type NewDiaryEntry. 
    //! This means we should check EACH field SEPARATELY.(see above)

    const newEntry : NewDiaryEntry ={
        comment: parseComment(object.comment),
        date: parseComment(object.date),
        weather: parseWeather(object.weather),
        visibility: parseVisibility(object.visibility)
    };
    return newEntry;
